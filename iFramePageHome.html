<body>

	<div>
		Main Display Window (main)
		<br>
		<br>
		Maybe have this load separate pages with a different sidebar on each, <br>
		so that there can be a fancier "element-sidebar-active" thing, like a green bar on <br>
		the left of the menu item that is selected.<br>
		Also would get rid of the weird iFrame pages and give actual page links.<br>
		Would also remove need for messy javascript with lots of menu items.<br>
		Alternatively, learn more js and possibly jquery. And maybe php.<br>
		<br>
		Or, the menu could be iframed and linked to from each page.
		So, the opposite.
